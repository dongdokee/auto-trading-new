- PROJECT_ROADMAP_AND_STATUS.md
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md
- ENVIRONMENT.md
- DOCUMENT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md
- MODULE_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md
- README.md

### docs/ Directory

- software-engineering-guide.md

### Module Documentation
Module CLAUDE.md files are preserved in their original locations under src/*/CLAUDE.md

## Refactoring Changes Applied

1. **Consolidation**: TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md and ENVIRONMENT.md merged into PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
2. **Renaming**: PROJECT_ROADMAP_AND_STATUS.md â†’ PROJECT_STATUS.md
3. **Deduplication**: Removed redundant content across documents
4. **Restructuring**: CLAUDE.md simplified to navigation hub
5. **New Documents**: QUICK_START.md and ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md created
