This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Korean cryptocurrency futures automated trading system (ÏΩîÏù∏ ÏÑ†Î¨º ÏûêÎèôÎß§Îß§ ÏãúÏä§ÌÖú) currently in the design and planning phase. The system implements advanced quantitative trading strategies with sophisticated risk management and portfolio optimization.

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a microservices architecture with these main components:

- **Trading Engine**: Main coordination hub using Python/asyncio
- **Risk Manager**: Kelly optimization and VaR-based risk control
- **Strategy Engine**: Multi-strategy execution with regime detection
- **Order Executor**: Smart order routing and execution
- **Data Feed Service**: Real-time market data collection
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Redis, RabbitMQ

Key architectural patterns:
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for data operations
- Hexagonal architecture for clean separation of concerns

## Development Methodology & Coding Standards

### TDD and Clean Code Principles
**MUST FOLLOW**: `@docs/augmented-coding.md` - Kent Beck's TDD and Tidy First principles

**Core Development Cycle**:
1. **Red**: Write a failing test first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code structure (only after tests pass)

**Critical Rules**:
- Never mix structural changes with behavioral changes in same commit
- All tests must pass before any commit
- Separate commits for structural vs. behavioral changes
- Use meaningful test names that describe behavior
- One refactoring change at a time

### Engineering Best Practices
**Reference**: `@docs/software-engineering-guide.md` - Comprehensive engineering guidelines

**Key Principles**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has single responsibility
- **KISS & YAGNI**: Simple solutions, implement only when needed
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions
- **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, small functions, clear control flow

## Financial Engineering Components

The system implements sophisticated quantitative finance concepts:

- **Kelly Optimization**: Fractional Kelly criterion for position sizing
  - üìã **Reference**: `@docs/project-system-design/2-financial-engineering.md` (ÏÑπÏÖò 2.1-2.2)

- **Risk Management**: VaR models, drawdown monitoring, liquidation probability
  - üìã **Reference**: `@docs/project-system-design/4-risk-management.md`

- **Regime Detection**: HMM and GARCH models for market state identification
  - üìã **Reference**: `@docs/project-system-design/3-strategy-engine.md` (ÏÑπÏÖò 4)

- **Strategy Matrix**: Multi-strategy approach with trend following, mean reversion, funding arbitrage
  - üìã **Reference**: `@docs/project-system-design/3-strategy-engine.md`

- **Portfolio Optimization**: Dynamic allocation with risk constraints
  - üìã **Reference**: `@docs/project-system-design/5-portfolio-optimization.md`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow domain-driven design principles
- Implement clean architecture with clear boundaries
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Separate pure business logic from infrastructure concerns

üìã **Reference**: `@docs/software-engineering-guide.md` (ÏÑπÏÖò 1-4)

### TDD Workflow for Financial Components
Given the critical nature of financial calculations:

1. **Write comprehensive tests** with known expected outputs for mathematical functions
2. **Test edge cases**: Zero positions, extreme market conditions, boundary values
3. **Validate against benchmarks**: Compare risk metrics to established financial models
4. **Continuous refactoring**: Keep financial logic clean and maintainable

üìã **Reference**: `@docs/augmented-coding.md` for strict TDD discipline

### Performance Requirements
- Sub-100ms latency for order execution critical path
- Real-time processing of market data feeds
- Efficient handling of large time series datasets
- Scalable architecture for multiple trading pairs

üìã **Reference**: `@docs/project-system-design/7-market-microstructure.md` for latency requirements

### Security Considerations
- API keys stored in environment variables or secure key management
- No credentials in code or version control
- Encrypted communication for sensitive data
- Comprehensive audit logging for all trading activities

- Use time-boxing to avoid infinite debugging loops
- Ask for help when stuck (especially for financial calculations)
- Maintain growth mindset and learn from failures

## Risk and Compliance

- Implement circuit breakers for extreme market conditions
